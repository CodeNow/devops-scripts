You are about to generate the CA for docker. If you do not know what you are about to do, I recommend not doing it.

You will be propted thrice for a pass phrase for `ca-key.pem`. Enter the same thing three times. Remember this, record it somewhere, or use something logical.

You then will be asked for some information about the cert you are creating. Here's exactly what you should enter:

Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]: US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]: California
Locality Name (eg, city) []: San Francisco
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]: Runnable
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []: Ops
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []: localhost
Email Address []: ops@runnable.com
